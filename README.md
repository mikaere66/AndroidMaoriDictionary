# Android Maori Dictionary
This project was originally just a way for me to learn Android/Java programming. It's based on an SQLite database, so is totally offline, and doesn't require any special permissions. The database contains 1204 Māori to English translations, and 1419 English to Māori translations.
Like most projects, it started out simple, then ballooned into what you see today. I hope that by sharing what I've achieved, it will help others to pick up a few skills, and have some fun along the way!
Because it contains some pretty high-end features, minSdkVersion is 17 (JellyBean 4.2).
I'm quite sure it's error-free, but I've only tested it on my Samsung Galaxy Express II, and the standard Android and Genymotion emulators. If you find a bug, or can think of something which could be done better, please let me know =)
